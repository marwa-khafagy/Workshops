# Computing Workshops Repository

## Overview

Welcome to my Computing Workshops Repository! Here, you'll find a compilation of materials, code samples, and resources gathered from a computer science workshop I recently attended. Please note that this repository is a dynamic work in progress, currently featuring content from a single workshop. I intend to expand its scope by adding more material as I attend additional workshops, with the goal of sharing knowledge, code, and insights within the broader community. Stay tuned for ongoing updates and enriching content!

## Getting Started

To get started with a specific workshop, navigate to the corresponding directory and follow the instructions in the README file provided. The README file typically includes information on prerequisites, installation steps, and how to run example code.

## Contributing

If you've attended a workshop not covered in this repository and would like to contribute materials, code, or additional resources, feel free to submit a pull request. Contributions from the community are highly encouraged!

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your contribution: `git checkout -b feature/new-workshop`.
3. Add your workshop materials to the appropriate directory.
4. Update the main README file with a brief description of the new workshop.
5. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Add materials for Workshop X."`
6. Push to your branch: `git push origin feature/new-workshop`.
7. Open a pull request, and provide a detailed description of your changes.

Happy coding!
