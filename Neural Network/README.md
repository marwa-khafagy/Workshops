## Workshop Content

### Neural Network for Cancer Classification

In this workshop, you'll find resources for building and training a neural network designed to classify whether a given cancer is malignant or benign. The main components of this workshop include:

1. **Google Colab Notebook**: `McMasterAI_Workshop2_NeuralNetworks.ipynb`
   - This interactive Jupyter notebook is hosted on Google Colab and contains the code for creating and training the neural network. Open this notebook to step through the process of developing a cancer classification model.

2. **Data Files**:
   - `input_data.csv`: This CSV file contains the input data required for training the neural network. Each row represents a set of features associated with a specific cancer case.

   - `output_data.csv`: The corresponding CSV file holds the output labels for the corresponding cases in `input_data.csv`. It specifies whether the associated cancer is malignant (1) or benign (0).

### Getting Started

1. Open the Google Colab notebook (`McMasterAI_Workshop2_NeuralNetworks.ipynb`) to follow along with the workshop.
2. Upload the provided data files (`input_data.csv` and `output_data.csv`) to Google Colab.

Feel free to experiment with the code, tweak parameters, and explore the dataset to gain a deeper understanding of neural network applications in cancer classification. If you have any questions or run into issues, don't hesitate to reach out for assistance. 

Happy learning!
